# Final HeyGen Scripts - Quantum Computing Lesson
## Streamlined for Credibility

## **SCRIPT 1: INTRO + QUESTION 1 + ALL CHOICES**
### Duration: ~60 seconds
```
Welcome back! Today we're exploring quantum computing - technology that's moving from research labs into real applications. Companies like Google and IBM are building computers that use quantum physics to solve certain problems much faster than regular computers.

Here's what matters for you: these machines could eventually break current internet encryption. Imagine quantum computers become powerful enough to crack your banking security, private messages, government communications - all suddenly vulnerable. How should the world respond?

Option A: Develop quantum-resistant encryption and ensure global access to secure communication.

Option B: Ban quantum computing research to prevent security risks.

Option C: Let governments and tech companies handle quantum security privately.

Choose your answer.

## **SCRIPT 2: QUESTION 1 CORRECT FEEDBACK**
### Duration: ~35 seconds
```
Smart thinking. You understand that stopping quantum research isn't realistic - other countries won't stop developing this technology. The solution isn't avoiding quantum computing, but preparing for it. Quantum-resistant encryption is already being developed, and making it globally accessible means everyone can protect their privacy, not just those with resources.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 3: QUESTION 1 INCORRECT FEEDBACK A**
### Duration: ~30 seconds
```
I understand the concern, but banning quantum research would be difficult to enforce globally. Other nations and institutions will continue this work regardless. Instead of protection, bans often drive research underground. The better approach is developing defenses while the technology is still emerging.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 4: QUESTION 1 INCORRECT FEEDBACK B**
### Duration: ~30 seconds
```
That approach leaves ordinary people out of important decisions about their digital security. When powerful technologies develop behind closed doors, they often serve the interests of their creators rather than the public. Democratic input on quantum governance helps ensure these tools serve everyone's security needs.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 5: QUESTION 1 REINFORCEMENT**
### Duration: ~20 seconds
```
So our options are: build quantum-safe security for everyone, try to ban research that's happening globally, or let others decide our digital security. I'm thinking the approach that protects everyone's privacy makes the most sense.
```

## **SCRIPT 6: QUESTION 2 SETUP + ALL CHOICES**
### Duration: ~45 seconds
```
Alright, here's where it gets interesting. Quantum computing requires massive resources - facilities colder than space, rare materials, extreme precision. This creates a question: how do we ensure quantum benefits don't just flow to wealthy countries and corporations?

So is it creating international quantum research cooperatives with shared access, or maybe letting market forces make quantum technology cheaper and more accessible over time, or could it be that we should just accept that only wealthy nations should control quantum computing?

What's your choice?
```

---

## **SCRIPT 7: QUESTION 2 CORRECT FEEDBACK**
### Duration: ~35 seconds
```
Yup! Just like international space programs and particle physics research, quantum cooperatives could democratize access to this computing power. This approach recognizes that quantum challenges - climate modeling, drug discovery, economic optimization - affect everyone and require shared resources to solve effectively.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 8: QUESTION 2 INCORRECT FEEDBACK A**
### Duration: ~35 seconds
```
That's not quite the best option, here's why. Unlike smartphones that became cheaper through mass production, quantum computers need near-absolute-zero temperatures and incredibly precise control systems. Think about how shared quantum cloud services might be better because the physics may prevent personal quantum computers. The real question is whether quantum access gets controlled by a few corporations or structured as shared global resources.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 9: QUESTION 2 INCORRECT FEEDBACK B**
### Duration: ~35 seconds
```
That approach isn't quite right because concentrating quantum power would create significant technological inequality. If quantum advantages in medicine, climate science, and economic modeling flow only to wealthy nations, it could destabilize global cooperation and reduce innovation. Think about how sharing powerful technologies might be better because history shows that creates more progress than hoarding them.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 10: QUESTION 2 REINFORCEMENT**
### Duration: ~20 seconds
```
Our choices: share quantum resources internationally, wait for markets to make it accessible, or accept quantum inequality. I'm thinking the one that serves global problem-solving best is pretty clear.
```

## **SCRIPT 11: QUESTION 3 SETUP + ALL CHOICES**
### Duration: ~50 seconds
```
This final one will really make you think. Quantum communication offers something unprecedented - perfectly secure channels where any attempt to intercept messages gets automatically detected. This could revolutionize secure communication for journalists, diplomats, and citizens. How should this capability develop?

So do you think we should use quantum-secured channels to enable new forms of international cooperation and transparency, or maybe focus quantum communication primarily on business and government applications, or could it be that quantum communication is just too complex for ordinary people to understand or benefit from?

Your choice?
```

---

## **SCRIPT 12: QUESTION 3 CORRECT FEEDBACK**
### Duration: ~40 seconds
```
Perfect! Quantum communication could enable unprecedented transparency in international agreements - arms control verification, climate monitoring, diplomatic negotiations - because all parties would know their communications haven't been tampered with. This isn't science fiction either; quantum communication networks are already being tested in several countries.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 13: QUESTION 3 INCORRECT FEEDBACK A**
### Duration: ~40 seconds
```
That's not quite the full picture, here's why. While businesses and governments will certainly use quantum communication, this view misses broader possibilities. Think about how broader access might be better because quantum-secured channels could protect investigative journalists, enable secure voting, and allow human rights organizations to communicate without surveillance. The question is whether quantum communication develops as a tool for transparency or just convenience.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 14: QUESTION 3 INCORRECT FEEDBACK B**
### Duration: ~40 seconds
```
That approach isn't quite right because you don't need to understand quantum mechanics to benefit from quantum communication, just like you don't need to understand semiconductors to use your phone. Think about how citizen participation might be better because you don't need technical expertise to participate in decisions about quantum access, funding, and governance. We regularly make policy decisions about technologies we use but don't fully understand.
```

---

## **SCRIPT 15: QUESTION 3 REINFORCEMENT**
### Duration: ~20 seconds
```
So we can use quantum communication for international cooperation, limit it to institutions, or assume it's too complex for public benefit. I'm thinking the one that serves democratic communication is pretty obvious.
```

## **SCRIPT 16: FORTUNE INTRODUCTION**
### Duration: ~5 seconds
```
You just earned your daily fortune...
```

---

## **SCRIPT 17: KELLY'S 3x3x3 FORTUNE**
### Duration: ~45 seconds
```
Today, June 28, 2025, is a perfect day to realize power about quantum possibilities and democratic participation. Because technology about innovation without citizen input is just corporate control. You are a quantum citizen and quantum citizens understand that the future isn't predetermined. 

If you don't like physics or computing, or you love practical applications and not theoretical concepts, or who cares about any of these - it's just about having a voice in technologies that will shape your world. 

It's going to be ok because we can explore quantum concepts at any time. If you are looking for scientific understanding or policy engagement, here's how to discover more. If you run into a topic, just click on 'quantum + society' and I'll make you a UL.

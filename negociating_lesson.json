      "voice_text": "{{WELCOME_MESSAGE}} Today we're exploring negotiation skills - not the adversarial, win-lose kind you might see in movies, but principled negotiation that creates solutions everyone can live with. Whether you're discussing household responsibilities, workplace decisions, or community issues, these skills help you find collaborative paths forward. The foundation of effective negotiation is understanding that most conflicts aren't really about positions - they're about underlying interests and needs. Here's what I want to know: When you're in a disagreement with someone, what's your typical approach? Do you focus on defending your position and trying to convince them you're right, or do you try to understand what's really driving their concerns?",
      "on_screen_text": "Your usual approach in disagreements?\n\nA) Defend my position and convince them I'm right\nB) Understand what's driving their concerns",

      "voice_text": "That's a natural instinct - most people start by defending their position. It feels like the logical approach: you know what you want, so you argue for it. But here's what negotiation research shows: when people focus on positions, they often miss the real solution. Think about two people fighting over an orange. If they focus on positions - 'I need the orange!' - they might split it in half. But if they explore interests, they might discover one person needs the peel for baking and the other needs the fruit for juice. Everyone gets what they actually need. The key is shifting from 'How do I win?' to 'How do we both get what we really need?'",

      "voice_text": "Excellent instinct. You understand that effective negotiation starts with curiosity, not advocacy. When you focus on understanding what's really driving someone's concerns, you're practicing principled negotiation. You recognize that people's positions - what they say they want - often hide their deeper interests and needs. This approach transforms conflicts from battles into collaborative problem-solving sessions. You're not just trying to get your way; you're trying to understand the whole situation so you can find solutions that address everyone's core concerns. This mindset is the foundation of all successful negotiation.",

      "type": "question2_setup",
      "voice_text": "Now let's explore the most powerful tool in negotiation: asking the right questions. The magic happens when you shift from making statements to asking questions that uncover interests. Instead of saying 'That won't work,' you might ask 'What would need to be different for this to work for you?' Instead of 'That's too expensive,' try 'Help me understand what drives that pricing.' These questions don't show weakness - they show strategic thinking. You're gathering information to create better solutions. Here's what I'm curious about: When someone proposes something you don't like, what do you think works better - immediately explaining why their idea won't work, or asking questions to understand their reasoning first?",

      "type": "question2_option_a",
      "voice_text": "I understand that impulse - when you see problems with an idea, you want to point them out quickly. But jumping straight to objections often shuts down the conversation before you understand what you're really dealing with. When you immediately explain why something won't work, the other person usually stops listening and starts defending. Instead, try asking questions first: 'What would that accomplish?' or 'How do you see that working?' You might discover their idea addresses a real concern you hadn't considered, or that a small modification could make it work for everyone. Questions before objections keeps the conversation collaborative.",

      "type": "question2_option_b",
      "voice_text": "Perfect. You understand that questions are more powerful than statements in negotiation. When you ask about someone's reasoning before sharing your concerns, you accomplish several things: you gather crucial information, you show respect for their thinking, and you keep the conversation collaborative. You recognize that understanding their logic might reveal solutions you hadn't considered, or help you frame your concerns in ways they can actually hear. This approach - inquiry before advocacy - prevents the conversation from becoming a debate and keeps it focused on problem-solving together.",

      "voice_text": "Now for the most important principle: separating people from problems. In any negotiation, you're dealing with two things - the relationship and the issue. When these get tangled together, even small disagreements can damage important relationships. The key is to be hard on the problem but soft on the person. You can disagree strongly with someone's idea while still treating them with respect and curiosity. This isn't just about being nice - it's strategically smart. When people feel respected, they're more likely to share information, consider your perspective, and work with you toward solutions. Here's my question: When you're in a tense negotiation, what do you think is more effective - focusing on being right about the issue, or focusing on maintaining the relationship while solving the problem?",
      "on_screen_text": "In tense negotiations, what's more effective?\n\nA) Focus on being right about the issue\nB) Maintain the relationship while solving the problem",

      "type": "question3_option_a",
      "voice_text": "That's a common trap - focusing so hard on being right that you damage the relationship and often miss the best solution. When you prioritize being right over solving the problem together, you typically get resistance instead of collaboration. People dig in to defend their positions, information stops flowing, and even if you 'win,' you may have created long-term relationship costs. The more effective approach is to separate the people from the problem. You can disagree completely with someone's proposal while still treating them as a partner in solving the underlying challenge. When people feel respected, they're much more likely to share the information you need to find solutions that actually work.",

      "voice_text": "Exactly right. You understand that preserving the relationship while solving the problem isn't weakness - it's strategic brilliance. You recognize that when people feel respected and heard, they're much more likely to share information, consider your perspective, and work collaboratively toward solutions. You know how to disagree with ideas while still treating people as partners rather than opponents. This approach - being hard on the problem but soft on the person - often leads to breakthrough solutions that neither party initially imagined.

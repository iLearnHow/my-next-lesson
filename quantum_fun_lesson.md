## **SCRIPT 1: FUN OPENING + QUESTION 1 + ALL CHOICES**
### Duration: 60 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
Welcome to The Daily Lesson. I'm Kenny, and today we're diving into quantum computing - which is basically like regular computers went to wizard school and learned magic. Seriously, these things can be in multiple states at once, which sounds like something from a superhero movie.

But here's where it gets real - these quantum wizards could eventually crack every password on Earth. Picture this: you wake up tomorrow and every secure thing - your bank account, your private messages, top secret government stuff - suddenly becomes readable by anyone with a quantum computer. Wild, right?

So what should we do? Should we create super-strong quantum-proof encryption that protects everyone globally, or ban quantum research to stop the danger, or just let big tech and governments handle it privately?

You can say 'A' or 'quantum-proof encryption'
You can say 'B' or 'ban quantum research'
Or say 'C' or 'let big tech handle it'

What's your pick?
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🧙‍♂️ QUANTUM COMPUTERS = WIZARD COMPUTERS

💥 COULD CRACK ALL PASSWORDS 💥

Your Options:

🛡️ A) Create quantum-proof encryption for everyone
🚫 B) Ban quantum research 
🏢 C) Let big tech & governments decide

VOICE COMMANDS:
Say "A" or "quantum-proof encryption"
Say "B" or "ban quantum research"  
Say "C" or "let big tech handle it"
```

## **SCRIPT 2: CORRECT FEEDBACK (Option A)**
### Duration: 35 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'quantum-proof encryption' - boom! Smart thinking! You get that we can't exactly call up China and say "Hey, could you stop building quantum computers? Thanks!" The genie's out of the bottle. So instead of playing defense, we go on offense - build encryption so strong that even quantum wizards can't crack it, and make sure everyone gets it, not just the rich kids.

Ready for round two?
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🎯 SMART CHOICE!

✅ Can't stop global quantum research
✅ Build stronger defenses instead
✅ Share protection with everyone

🔥 QUANTUM WISDOM UNLOCKED 🔥

Ready for Question 2?
```

---

## **SCRIPT 3: INCORRECT FEEDBACK A (Option B)**
### Duration: 35 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'ban quantum research' - I get the instinct! If it's dangerous, ban it, right? But here's the thing: quantum research is happening in labs from Silicon Valley to Shanghai right now. Banning it here just means other countries get there first, and then we're the ones left vulnerable. It's like trying to uninvent gunpowder.

Let's keep rolling!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🤔 I GET THE LOGIC BUT...

❌ Quantum research is global
❌ Bans = other countries get ahead
❌ Can't uninvent physics

💡 Better to prepare defenses!

Ready for Question 2?
```

## **SCRIPT 4: INCORRECT FEEDBACK B (Option C)**
### Duration: 35 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'let big tech handle it' - and honestly, that's what most people think. Let the experts expert, right? But here's the plot twist: when tech companies make decisions behind closed doors, they usually optimize for their profits, not your privacy. Do you really want your digital security designed by the same people who gave us targeted ads?

Onward to question two!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🏢 TRUSTING THE EXPERTS?

⚠️ Companies optimize for profit
⚠️ Not necessarily your privacy  
⚠️ Remember targeted ads?

🗳️ Citizens deserve a voice!

Ready for Question 2?
```

---

## **SCRIPT 5: REINFORCEMENT**
### Duration: 25 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
So our options were: build quantum-safe security for everyone, try to ban unstoppable research, or trust big tech with our digital lives. The choice that actually protects people is pretty obvious.

Alright, question two is where this gets really sci-fi!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
📊 THE VERDICT:

🛡️ Quantum-proof encryption for all = 🏆
🚫 Ban research = ❌  
🏢 Trust big tech = 🤷‍♂️

🚀 NEXT: THE SCI-FI STUFF!
```

## **SCRIPT 6: QUESTION 2 SETUP + ALL CHOICES**
### Duration: 50 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
OK, here's where quantum gets absolutely bonkers. These computers need to be kept colder than outer space - I'm talking negative 273 degrees Celsius. They need rare materials, crazy precision, basically the technological equivalent of building a spaceship to do your homework.

Which means quantum computers are going to be stupidly expensive. But they could solve climate change, cure diseases, predict economic crashes - world-saving stuff. So what happens when only rich countries can afford the good stuff?

Should we create international quantum co-ops where everyone shares access, or let market forces make it cheaper over time like smartphones, or just accept that quantum power belongs to whoever can afford it?

You can say 'A' or 'quantum co-ops'
You can say 'B' or 'market forces'
Or say 'C' or 'quantum inequality'

Your call?
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🥶 QUANTUM COMPUTERS ARE FREEZING COLD!
❄️ Colder than outer space ❄️

💰 SUPER EXPENSIVE BUT COULD:
🌍 Solve climate change
💊 Cure diseases  
📈 Predict economic crashes

Your Options:

🤝 A) International quantum co-ops
📱 B) Let markets make it cheaper (like phones)
💸 C) Accept quantum inequality

VOICE COMMANDS:
Say "A" or "quantum co-ops"
Say "B" or "market forces"
Say "C" or "quantum inequality"
```

---

## **SCRIPT 7: CORRECT FEEDBACK (Option A)**
### Duration: 35 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'quantum co-ops' - yes! You're thinking like a global citizen! It's like how we share those massive space telescopes and particle accelerators. Climate change doesn't respect borders, diseases spread everywhere, so why should the computers that could solve these problems only help whoever has the biggest bank account?

Final question coming up - this one's my favorite!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🌍 GLOBAL THINKING!

✅ Share expensive tech globally
✅ Climate problems = global problems
✅ Like space telescopes for everyone

🎯 QUANTUM COOPERATION UNLOCKED!

Final Question Coming Up!
```

---

## **SCRIPT 8: INCORRECT FEEDBACK A (Option B)**
### Duration: 35 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'market forces' - and hey, it worked for smartphones, right? Everyone has one now! But quantum computers aren't like phones. You can't mass-produce something that needs to be colder than space. The physics might mean we only ever get quantum cloud computing, and the question is who controls those clouds.

Last question time - this one's wild!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
📱 SMARTPHONES GOT CHEAPER BUT...

❄️ Can't mass-produce space-cold computers
☁️ Probably just quantum cloud services
🤔 Who controls the quantum clouds?

⚠️ Physics limits mass production!

Final Question Coming Up!
```

---

## **SCRIPT 9: INCORRECT FEEDBACK B (Option C)**
### Duration: 35 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'quantum inequality' - whoa, that's pretty dystopian! If only rich countries get quantum advantages in medicine and climate science, we're looking at a seriously unequal world. History shows us that hoarding powerful tech usually backfires - sharing creates more innovation and cooperation than keeping secrets.

Final question - prepare to have your mind blown!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
😰 QUANTUM DYSTOPIA!

💔 Rich countries only = inequality
🌍 Global problems need global solutions
📚 History: sharing > hoarding

🤝 Cooperation beats competition!

Final Question - Mind = Blown!
```

---

## **SCRIPT 10: REINFORCEMENT**
### Duration: 25 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
So: share quantum globally, wait for capitalism to work its magic, or accept a quantum digital divide. The sharing option wins pretty clearly if you want a better world.

This final question is straight out of a spy thriller!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
📊 THE QUANTUM VERDICT:

🤝 Global sharing = 🌟
📈 Market forces = 🤷‍♂️
💸 Accept inequality = 😱

🕵️ FINAL: SPY THRILLER MODE!
```

## **SCRIPT 11: QUESTION 3 SETUP + ALL CHOICES**
### Duration: 55 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
Last question, and this is straight-up spy movie stuff! Quantum communication creates perfectly secure messages - like mathematically impossible to hack. If someone even tries to eavesdrop, the message self-destructs and everyone knows someone was listening. This isn't science fiction - they're building these networks right now!

Picture journalists talking to sources with zero surveillance, diplomats negotiating where everyone knows the line is secure, citizens communicating privately without any government listening in. It's like having an unbreakable secret code.

So how should this develop? Use quantum communication to enable new international cooperation with perfect trust, focus it mainly on business and government security, or is this too complex for regular people to benefit from?

You can say 'A' or 'international cooperation'
You can say 'B' or 'business focus'
Or say 'C' or 'too complex'

What do you think?
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🕵️ SPY-LEVEL SECURITY!

🔒 QUANTUM MESSAGES:
✨ Mathematically unhackable
💥 Self-destruct if intercepted  
🚨 Auto-detects eavesdropping

🌟 POSSIBILITIES:

🗣️ Private citizen communication

Your Options:

🌍 A) Enable international cooperation
🏢 B) Focus on business/government  
🤯 C) Too complex for regular people

VOICE COMMANDS:
Say "A" or "international cooperation"
Say "B" or "business focus"
Say "C" or "too complex"
```

---

## **SCRIPT 12: CORRECT FEEDBACK (Option A)**
### Duration: 40 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'international cooperation' - absolutely brilliant! Imagine climate negotiations where every country knows their communications are completely secure, or arms control where everyone can verify without doubt. This could enable cooperation we've never had before because trust becomes mathematically guaranteed. And this isn't sci-fi - quantum networks are being tested right now in China and Europe!

Time for your reward!
```

## **SCRIPT 13: INCORRECT FEEDBACK A (Option B)**
### Duration: 40 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'business focus' - and sure, businesses and governments will definitely use this first. But think bigger! What about investigative journalists protecting sources? Secure voting? Human rights groups in authoritarian countries? The question is whether quantum communication becomes a tool for transparency or just another luxury for those with power.

You've earned your fortune!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🏢 BUSINESS FIRST, BUT...

🤔 THINK BIGGER:
📰 Protect journalist sources
🗳️ Secure voting systems
✊ Human rights organizations

❓ Tool for transparency OR luxury?

🎁 FORTUNE TIME!
```

---

## **SCRIPT 14: INCORRECT FEEDBACK B (Option C)**
### Duration: 40 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
You said 'too complex' - but here's the thing: you don't need to understand quantum mechanics to use quantum communication, just like you don't need to know semiconductors to use your phone. And more importantly, you don't need a physics PhD to have opinions about how this gets developed, funded, and regulated. Technology policy is citizenship, not just engineering!

Fortune time!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
🤯 TOO COMPLEX?

🤷‍♂️ DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND:
📱 How phones work to use them
🚗 How cars work to drive them
💻 How internet works to browse it

🗳️ TECH POLICY = CITIZENSHIP!

🎁 FORTUNE UNLOCKED!
```

---

## **SCRIPT 15: REINFORCEMENT + FORTUNE SETUP**
### Duration: 30 seconds

**VOICE OVER:**
```
So quantum communication for international cooperation, limit it to institutions, or assume it's too complex for public benefit. The cooperation option creates the most interesting future by far.

You just tackled quantum security, global resource sharing, and democratic communication. That's some serious future-citizen thinking right there!
```

**ON SCREEN:**
```
📊 QUANTUM COMMUNICATION VERDICT:

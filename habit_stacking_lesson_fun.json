Think of it like building with LEGOs for your life. Instead of fighting your brain, we're going to hack it! You know how you always remember to check your phone? We're going to use those automatic behaviors as springboards for awesome new habits. So tell me - when you've tried to build habits before, what's been your go-to strategy? Do you usually pump yourself up with motivation and try to willpower your way through, or do you get sneaky and design clever systems that make good stuff happen automatically?",

      "voice_text": "Oh, the classic motivation-and-muscle approach! I totally get it - it feels so heroic, right? Like you're going to willpower your way to victory! But here's the plot twist: your brain is actually working against you. Motivation is like that friend who's super enthusiastic about plans but flakes out when it's time to actually do them. And willpower? It's like your phone battery - starts strong in the morning but dies by evening when you need it most! That's why your evening workout plans get murdered by Netflix. The secret sauce is designing systems so sneaky that good habits just... happen. No heroics required!",

While everyone else is white-knuckling their way through willpower, you're over here playing 4D chess with your brain. You've discovered that automatic behaviors are like cheat codes for life. Your brain is already programmed with dozens of routines, and you're smart enough to hijack those patterns for your own success. This is exactly what habit stacking is all about - being cleverly lazy instead of heroically exhausted!",

      "voice_text": "Okay, time for the magic formula! Habit stacking is stupidly simple: 'After I do this thing I already do, I will do this new thing I want to do.' It's like creating a domino effect in your routine. For example: 'After I pour my coffee - BOOM - I write down three priorities.' Your existing habit becomes the trigger that launches your new habit into orbit! Your brain loves this because it's efficient - no extra thinking required. Now here's the million-dollar question: When you're picking your anchor habit, what do you think works better - going for a habit you nail perfectly every single day like some kind of robot, or choosing a habit that you do super frequently and automatically, even if you're human and occasionally forget?",

The real gold is in those frequent, automatic behaviors you do without thinking. Making coffee, checking your phone, sitting at your desk, getting in your car - these are your habit-stacking goldmines! They happen in specific places and times, they're already wired into your brain, and best of all, they don't require you to be a productivity robot. You're looking for reliable, not perfect. Think of it like this: would you rather build on rock that's there 90% of the time, or wait for the perfect rock that shows up once in a blue moon?",

Coffee making, phone checking, desk sitting - these seemingly boring actions are actually your secret weapons! They happen naturally, they're tied to specific contexts, and they don't require you to be some kind of productivity superhero. You've cracked the code: reliability is way more powerful than perfection. You're going to absolutely crush habit stacking with this mindset!",
